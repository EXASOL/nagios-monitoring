1.	Subject of this Agreement
1.1	For the purposes of this agreement "Software" 
shall mean the software with the object code, the ver-
sion and the specification indicated in the software 
product data sheet of Fujitsu Technology Solutions.
The Software consists of machine-readable instruc-
tions and/or printed documentation and related li-
censed materials. 
1.2	Please read this agreement carefully before 
you use the Software. If you do not agree with the li-
cense terms in this agreement, you are not permitted 
to use the Software and must immediately return all

the Licensor/Sublicensor (either Fujitsu Technology 
Solutions or the reseller who supplied you with the 
Software) with proof of purchase for a full refund. 
1.3	Any use of the Software requires the proper 
payment of the applicable license fees. By using the 
Software you agree to be bound by the terms of this 
agreement. 
1.4	Fujitsu Technology Solutions reserves the right 
to implement at any time in the future an additional 
software license key and/or license certificates as 
countermeasures against software piracy.  
1.5	Software components from third-party software 
suppliers which are part of the scope of the delivery 
are subject to separate license agreements that are 
included with the Software or that are transmitted by 
Fujitsu Technology Solutions upon request. 
2.	End User License 
2.1	Fujitsu Technology Solutions grants you a non-
exclusive and non-transferable license to use the 
Software on the number of workstations for which you 
have purchased licenses. Unless you purchase addi-
tional licenses, you are not permitted to operate the 
Software on more than the maximum number of li-
censed workstations or on hardware that exceeds the 
specified type. 
You are permitted to make a backup copy of the 
Software for archiving purposes, provided you prop-
erly mark the copy or partial copy of the Software with 
the copyright notice and any other ownership informa-
tion. 
2.2	You are not permitted to copy, modify or dis-
tribute the Software. Furthermore, you are not permit-
ted to re-compile, re-engineer, convert, revise, com-
pile or modify the Software. You may not sub-license, 
without selling the related hardware, assign, rent, 
lease or transfer the Software except as expressly 
permitted by this agreement or due to mandatory legal 
regulations. 
2.3	If you acquired the Software as a program up-
grade, your license for the use of the old software 
version ends automatically with the installation of the 
upgrade version of the Software. If parts of the old 
software version are not replaced by the upgrade ver-
sion, the license for the old version continues to be 
effective until the remnants of the old software version 
are also replaced or deactivated or shut down in any 
other way. 
2.4	Unless specified otherwise in the respective 
software data sheet of Fujitsu Technology Solutions, 
the license for a software version or release does not 
give you any rights to new releases (updates), new 
versions (upgrades) or technical support services for 
the Software. Supplemental software support con-
tracts and maintenance services, including or exclud-
ing new releases and new versions and additional 
technical support services, can be purchased sepa-
rately either from Fujitsu Technology Solutions directly 
or from authorized software resellers. 
3.	Downloading
For Software supplied by Fujitsu Technology Solu-
tions over a network or a similar distribution path, the 
following additional conditions shall apply:  
All products supplied for downloading by Fujitsu 
Technology Solutions are selected, made available 
and - if supplied by third parties - provided without 
modification. However, you are fully responsible for 
ensuring the most current version and usability of 
downloadable material for your own purposes and on 
your own system. You download Software at your 
own risk. Fujitsu Technology Solutions will not accept 
any liability, particularly not for transmission errors or 
problems that arise during the downloading process 
(line failures, connection interruptions, server failures, 
data corruption, etc.). 
The website of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is oper-
ated and administered only for those countries in 
which Fujitsu Technology Solutions has one or more 
offices. Fujitsu Technology Solutions accepts no re-
sponsibility that Software and/or documentation can 
or may be downloaded from a Fujitsu Technology So-
lutions website also in locations other than the coun-
tries mentioned above. If you access a website of Fu-
jitsu Technology Solutions from abroad, you are fully 
responsible for complying with any local regulations. 
Fujitsu Technology Solutions expressly prohibits the 
downloading of Software and/or documentation from a 
Fujitsu Technology Solutions website in countries 
where such downloading is considered illegal. 
4.	Copyright
All rights and licenses, unless they are expressly 
granted to you in this license terms, as well as all 
property and usage rights related to the Software (in-
cluding parts of the Software) remain fully with Fujitsu 
Technology Solutions and/or its third-party licensors. 
The license terms do not authorize you to use the 
brands, logos or trademarks of Fujitsu Technology 
Solutions or its third-party licensors, nor are you per-
mitted to use any other brands which are deceptively 
similar to the brands, logos or trademarks of Fujitsu 
Technology Solutions. Each and any use of brands, 
logos or trademarks with respect to the Software or 
Fujitsu Technology Solutions requires the express 
consent of Fujitsu Technology Solutions. 
5.	Licensor's warranty and liability disclaimer, 
if Software is sold and delivered by Reseller 
If you acquire the Software directly from an authorized 
reseller (called "Reseller"), the right to install and use 
the Software may be subject to additional software 
license conditions agreed upon between you as the 
licensee and the respective reseller. 
In all cases of an authorized software resale, the 
software is sublicensed and made available to the li-
censee directly by the Reseller. In such cases, Fujitsu 
Technology Solutions is not a contractual party of the 
software license agreement between you, as licensee 
and the Reseller, as far as the procurement of the 
software licenses are concerned. Legal claims in con-
nection with the software licensing can therefore be 
asserted only on the basis of the agreements with the 
Reseller. Under no circumstances, however, will the 
respective scope of the license for the licensee ex-
ceed the scope of the license agreements as speci-
fied in sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 of this agreement.  
Subject to mandatory legal regulations, particularly 
those governing liability and/or warranties, which can-
not be excluded in connection with end user license 
agreement regulations and with reference to the li-
censee's claims against the Reseller, Fujitsu Tech-
nology Solutions disclaims all warranties for the Soft-
ware in this agreement. For the same reason, Fujitsu 
Technology Solutions disclaims any and all liabil-
ity/claims for any violations of third parties' rights as 
well as any implied warranties for the software's mar-
ketability and its suitability for a particular purpose. 
This disclaimer of liability does not apply in cases of 
willful or malicious behavior by Fujitsu Technology So-
lutions.
In this End User License Agreement, Fujitsu Technol-
ogy Solutions grants no warranties of any kind, either 
express or implied. 
6.	Disclaimer of liability with respect to share-
ware, freeware and/or open source software com-
ponents 
6.1	The Software may contain freeware or share-
ware which Fujitsu Technology Solutions received 
from a third party. Fujitsu Technology Solutions paid 
no license fees for the use of this freeware or share-
ware. Accordingly, the licensee is not charged any li-
cense fees for the use of the freeware or shareware. 
You recognize and accept that Fujitsu Technology So-
lutions therefore grants no warranties with respect to 
such freeware or shareware components and does 
not assume any liability in connection with the owner-
ship, the distribution and/or the use of the respective 
freeware or shareware. 
6.2	The Software may also contain open source 
software components that were developed according 
to the "open source model" and which are distributed 
exclusively on the basis of the GPL (General Public 
License: http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) terms 
and conditions or other standard open source stan-
dard license terms and conditions applicable to the 
respective open source components at the time of 
their dissemination. You recognize and accept that 
the licensing of such open source software compo-
nents is governed exclusively by the above-mentioned 
GPL terms or by the conditions which are otherwise 
included with the open source software components. 
Fujitsu Technology Solutions receives neither license 
fees nor any other compensation for the delivered 
open source software components. As far as Fujitsu 
Technology Solutions or a third party receives any 
compensation in connection with open source soft-
ware components, it is received exclusively for addi-
tional delivery items and/or services. 
Because of the special nature of the development and 
distribution of open source software components, Fu-
jitsu Technology Solutions assumes no express or 
implied liability for such components and excludes 
any kind of warranty for such open source software 
components, particularly in connection with missing 
specifications, lack of functionality, programming er-
rors or any other malfunctions. 
7.	General limitations of liability 
7.1	Neither Fujitsu Technology Solutions nor its 
suppliers are liable for any consequential or indirect 
damages, including damages arising as a result of or 
in connection with an operational interruption, lost 
profits or sales, lost data, or costs of capital. Fujitsu 
Technology Solutions and its suppliers will not be li-
able for additional ancillary or consequential costs or 
for any other losses, costs or expenses of any kind 
which arise as a result of the holding, sale, use or im-
possibility of use of the Software, independent of 
whether such claims are asserted due to warranty 
rights, contracts, tort or any other legal theory. 
7.2	The liability of Fujitsu Technology Solutions for 
direct damage caused as a result of a contract viola-
tion and/or other action or lapse on the part of Fujitsu 
Technology Solutions which have not been excluded 
or cannot be completely excluded due to mandatory 
law are limited to no more than ?250,000.00. Any and 
all other liabilities for direct damage are excluded. 
Damage caused by Fujitsu Technology Solutions as a 
result of slight negligence are excluded to the extent 
permitted by applicable legal regulations.  
7.3	Limitations and exclusions of liability resulting 
from this agreement do not apply to damage where 
Fujitsu Technology Solutions carries compulsory li-
ability according to applicable laws and where such 
liability cannot be limited to a maximum amount (for 
example, liability for bodily damage; product liability or 
fraudulently incorrect information). 


8.	Export controls 
Due to its components as well as the nature or pur-
pose of these components, the export of the Software 
and/or its accompanying documents may be subject 
to official or regulatory approval. In cases where the 
Software is intended for export, you are obliged to get 
all approvals and authorizations required to comply 
with all relevant export regulations.   
The Software may not be exported if there is reason 
to assume that the Software will be used in connec-
tion with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons or 
for missile technology. Furthermore, you may not de-
liver the Software - or have it delivered indirectly - 
to such companies or persons who are listed in the 
applicable U.S. export regulations (particularly the 
Table of Denial Orders/U.S. Denied Persons Lists 
(DPL) or in the E.U. export regulations (particularly 
the EU Terrorist List) or in the applicable warnings is-
sued by the German export authorities or any other 
competent authorities in any country.  
Under no circumstances is Fujitsu Technology Solu-
tions obligated to deliver software, patches, updates 
or upgrades, to provide software for download or to 
fulfill any other contractual commitments if this would 
be a violation of the applicable export regulations of 
the Federal Republic of Germany, the European Un-
ion, the United States of America or of any other 
countries.
If you export or re-export the Software or a copy of it, 
this may be a violation of applicable export laws and a 
severe violation of the terms of this agreement. 
9.	Miscellaneous
9.1	If any term or condition in this agreement or any 
other contract that is subject to the terms and condi-
tions of this agreement turns out to be invalid or unen-
forceable (partly or in full), the validity of all other 
terms and conditions remains unaffected, unless 
complying with the remaining terms and conditions 
would represent an unreasonable hardship for either 
contract party, even with the application of applicable 
legal regulations to close the legal gap.
9.2	If you/ the licensee do not pay the license fees 
due and/or if the licensee does not comply with es-
sential terms and conditions of this license agree-
ment, Fujitsu Technology Solutions reserves the right 
to cancel the license. In case of such cancellation, 
you must immediately return any and all copies of the 
software in your possession and confirm the complete 
return [of the software copies] or the destruction of 
these copies in writing. 
9.3	Neither you nor Fujitsu Technology Solutions is 
responsible or liable for the respective party's non-
compliance with its obligations if the reason for such 
non-compliance is outside the party's control due to 
force majeure.

to these license terms and conditions are only valid if 
they are made in writing. 


10.	Applicable law

erned by the laws of the Federal Republic of Ger-
